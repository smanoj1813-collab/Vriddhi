      explanationMd: `# Decode the Question Before You Solve It\n\nA difficult-looking question often becomes manageable once you translate it into a small, precise task. Before reaching for a formula or writing a paragraph, answer four questions: **What is being asked? What information is given? What conditions must stay true? What form should the answer take?**\n\n## 1. Read the command, not just the topic\nWords such as *calculate*, *explain*, *compare*, *justify* and *evaluate* ask for different work. “Compare” needs a shared basis and at least two sides. “Evaluate” needs evidence, a judgement and a reason for that judgement. A correct definition alone does not complete either task.\n\n## 2. Make a tiny question map\nWrite the target as **Find / Explain / Decide: ___**. List givens and constraints separately. In a numerical problem, label values with units; in a case or essay, list the facts, people affected, time period and evidence. This prevents a memorable but irrelevant fact from taking over the answer.\n\n## Worked example\nA shop buys 40 notebooks for ₹12 each and 60 for ₹18 each. What is the average cost per notebook? The target is an average **per notebook**. The quantities are unequal, so use a weighted average: total cost = 40×12 + 60×18 = ₹1,560; total notebooks = 100; average = ₹15.60. The simple mean (₹15) would incorrectly give both batches equal influence.\n\n## A useful representation\nTurn words into a table, timeline, diagram, equation, claim-evidence list or comparison grid. The best representation is the one that makes relationships visible—not the one that looks most advanced. State any assumption you add.`,

      explanationMd: `# Turn Understanding into a Clear Answer\n\nKnowing an idea and communicating it are different skills. A strong answer makes the reasoning visible, uses evidence where needed and ends by answering the exact question.\n\n## The Claim → Reason → Evidence → Link pattern\n1. **Claim:** give the direct answer or main point.\n2. **Reason:** explain the principle that makes it true.\n3. **Evidence/example:** show a calculation, fact, case detail or concrete example.\n4. **Link:** state how this proves the answer to the question.\n\nFor a short response, these may fit in four sentences. For a longer response, use them as the spine of each paragraph. Avoid opening with a long background section that delays the answer.\n\n## Worked example\nQuestion: “Why can a company report profit but still struggle to pay bills?”\n- **Claim:** Profit does not guarantee enough cash on the due date.\n- **Reason:** Profit records income and expenses for a period; cash flow records when money actually enters or leaves.\n- **Example:** A credit sale can increase revenue and profit today, while the customer pays next month.\n- **Link:** The company may therefore owe suppliers before collecting from customers.\n\n## Add depth without adding filler\nFor a comparison, use the same criterion on both sides. For a recommendation, name the objective, option, evidence, trade-off and next step. For a calculation, show the formula, substitution, result and interpretation. A diagram only helps when labels and a sentence explain what it shows.\n\n## Self-check\nCould a reader point to the sentence that answers the question? Can they follow how you reached it? Is each example relevant? If not, revise for logic before polishing wording.`,

      explanationMd: `# Choose the Right Method: Model the Problem\n\nA formula is not a magic shortcut. It is a compact model of a relationship. The right tool depends on what the quantities mean, how they relate and what the question asks.\n\n## A method-selection ladder\n- **Count or classify:** organise cases in a table or category list.\n- **Compare parts of a whole:** identify the correct base before using a ratio or percentage.\n- **Combine unequal groups:** use a weighted average, not an unweighted mean.\n- **Study change over time:** preserve the time order and distinguish a total from a rate.\n- **Explain a case:** connect evidence to a mechanism; do not just attach a framework label.\n- **Interpret data:** identify the population, sample, variables and uncertainty.\n\n## Worked example: choosing an average\nTwo tutorial groups have mean scores of 70 and 80. The first has 10 learners; the second has 30. The combined mean is not (70+80)/2 because the group sizes differ. Total score = 10×70 + 30×80 = 3,100; learners = 40; combined mean = 77.5. The model assumes both means use the same score scale and all learners count once.\n\n## Advanced habit: state the model boundary\nEvery method has conditions. A straight-line model assumes a constant rate; a sample mean describes the observed group but may not perfectly describe a population; a case framework is a lens, not proof. Write the assumption, solve, then ask whether the result still makes sense if the assumption is weakened.\n\n## Avoid two extremes\nDo not force a familiar formula onto a mismatched question. Also do not overcomplicate a simple relationship. Sketching a quick table often reveals the simplest valid method.`,

      explanationMd: `# Check Your Work: Units, Logic & Plausibility\n\nA polished calculation can still be wrong. Verification is part of solving, not an optional final decoration. Use checks that are independent of the step most likely to contain the error.\n\n## Four quick checks\n1. **Units:** do the units match the requested quantity? Adding metres to seconds is a warning; dividing distance by time should produce distance per time.\n2. **Sign and direction:** should the answer rise or fall when an input rises? Does a cost become negative without a reason?\n3. **Magnitude:** compare with a rough estimate or a known scale. A monthly amount mistaken for an annual amount is often exposed here.\n4. **Reverse or boundary check:** substitute the result back, undo the operation, or test a simple extreme case.\n\n## Worked example\nA student walks 1.5 km in 20 minutes. Convert 20 minutes to 1/3 hour, then speed = 1.5 ÷ (1/3) = 4.5 km/h. A result of 0.075 km/h signals that minutes and hours may have been mixed. A reverse check gives 4.5×(1/3)=1.5 km.\n\n## Check written reasoning too\nAsk whether the evidence actually supports the claim, whether a counterexample changes the conclusion, and whether the final sentence answers the prompt. A correlation check cannot establish cause by itself. A ratio without its comparison group can be misleading.\n\n## Precision is not accuracy\nExtra decimal places do not repair weak measurements or assumptions.

In an assessment, those cues may be absent. **Retrieval practice** means closing the notes and trying to reconstruct the idea, solve a fresh example or explain the concept aloud.

Hide the explanation and reproduce the main steps from memory.\n3. Check against the source and mark the exact gap.\n4. Revisit later, then mix the idea with a similar but different problem.\n\nSpacing means returning after a delay rather than cramming one long block. A simple starting schedule is same day, next day, several days later, then about a week later. Adjust it: if recall is easy, lengthen the gap; if it fails, shorten the gap and practise the missing step.\n\n## Worked example: learning a method\nInstead of reading a ratio solution three times, cover it and write: “What is the base? Which number is compared with it? Is the result a proportion or a percentage?” Then solve a new set of values and explain why the denominator is appropriate.\n\n## Interleave carefully\nAfter you can do one method alone, mix it with a similar method. For example, alternate a simple average and a weighted average so you learn to recognise when group sizes matter. If every question is mixed before you know either method, the exercise may feel random; build fluency first, then practise selection.\n\n## Measure learning by transfer\nThe goal is not to recite a paragraph exactly.

The balance sheet asks **what resources are controlled and who has claims on them?** The income statement asks **what was earned and used during a period?** Cash-flow information asks **when cash actually moved?** These views are related but not interchangeable.\n\n## The anchor equation\n**Assets = Liabilities + Equity.** Every recorded transaction keeps this relationship in balance. Assets are resources; liabilities are claims by others; equity is the owners’ residual claim. Revenue and expenses change equity through profit.\n\n## Worked transaction chain\nAn owner contributes ₹10,000 cash: assets +₹10,000 and equity +₹10,000. The business buys inventory for ₹3,000 cash: cash falls and inventory rises, so total assets do not change. It sells inventory that cost ₹800 for ₹1,200 cash: cash rises by ₹1,200, inventory falls by ₹800, and profit/equity rises by ₹400. Closing assets are ₹8,200 cash + ₹2,200 inventory = ₹10,400; equity is ₹10,000 capital + ₹400 profit. The equation still balances.\n\n## Debit and credit are directions, not everyday meanings\nDo not memorise “debit means money in” or “credit means money out.” Each account has a normal side. Assets and expenses normally increase by debit; liabilities, equity and revenue normally increase by credit. A transaction’s full entry preserves double-entry equality.\n\n## The deeper distinction: profit is not cash\nA credit sale may create revenue before cash is collected.

      explanationMd: `# Ratios with Meaning: Calculation, Comparison, Interpretation\n\nA ratio compresses a relationship; it does not automatically tell you whether a business is “good” or “bad.” A complete answer has three parts: calculate correctly, compare with a meaningful reference, then interpret the strength and limitation.\n\n## Start with the question the ratio answers\n- **Current ratio = current assets ÷ current liabilities:** a broad view of short-term coverage.\n- **Gross margin = gross profit ÷ revenue × 100%:** the share of sales left after direct cost of goods sold.\n- **Return on capital employed = operating profit ÷ capital employed × 100%:** operating return relative to longer-term funds invested.\n\n## Worked example\nCurrent assets are ₹240,000 and current liabilities ₹120,000. Current ratio = 2.0:1. That says current assets are twice current liabilities in total; it does **not** say all those assets can be used immediately. If ₹180,000 is slow-moving inventory and the remaining quick assets are ₹60,000, the quick ratio is only ₹60,000/₹120,000 = 0.5:1. The composition changes the interpretation.\n\n## Compare like with like\nA trend across several periods can reveal direction; a peer comparison can show relative position; a target can show a gap. Use the same definitions, period length and accounting basis. A seasonal business, an unusual one-off event or a change in policy may make the comparison unfair.\n\n## Strong interpretation sentence\n“X is ___, compared with ___; this suggests ___ because ___. However, ___ is a limitation, so we should also inspect ___.” This protects you from declaring that a single ratio proves overall performance.`,

The symptom is longer waiting. Before hiring more staff, inspect arrival rate, service time, menu complexity and order errors. Suppose transactions per hour rose 40% while staffing and kitchen layout stayed constant. Options might be a limited fast menu during peak time, pre-order pickup or additional staffing. Compare setup cost, expected queue reduction and customer impact; pilot one option for two weeks and track median wait and order accuracy.\n\n## Advanced caution: do not confuse correlation with diagnosis\nTwo events occurring together do not show that one caused the other.

A **segment** could be time-pressed campus learners; a **target** is the group the café can serve well; a **position** might be “fresh lunch ready in under five minutes.” The product could be a small rotating set of balanced meals; price should fit the students’ budget and costs; place could be a pickup counter near the main path; promotion should make the speed and menu visible where target learners decide.\n\n## Check the fit\nIf promotion promises “fast” but the process is slow, the mix contradicts itself. If a premium product is aimed at a price-sensitive segment, explain what value justifies the price or revise the target. A good answer links each choice to customer evidence and to the positioning.\n\n## Measure what the objective says\nFor a speed promise, track median preparation time and repeat purchase—not only social-media impressions. For awareness, a reach or recall measure may fit. Distinguish an activity (posting an ad) from an outcome (more qualified visits or purchases).\n\n## Use frameworks as scaffolds\nSegmentation variables and positioning maps help organise evidence, but they do not replace it.

It does not begin by trying to prove a favourite answer. It begins with a testable question, a clear measure and a plan that makes alternative explanations less likely.\n\n## Build the design\n- **Question:** specify the relationship or effect you will examine.\n- **Hypothesis:** make a prediction that could be contradicted by data.\n- **Independent variable:** the factor deliberately changed.\n- **Dependent variable:** the outcome measured.\n- **Controls:** conditions held as constant as practical.\n- **Repeats/sample:** enough observations to distinguish a pattern from random variation.\n\n## Worked example\nQuestion: does light intensity affect the growth rate of a plant species? Change light intensity across groups; measure height change over a fixed period. Keep species, soil, water, pot size and temperature as similar as possible, randomise pot positions if feasible, and use several plants per condition. If the high-light group also receives more water, light and water are confounded: the result cannot be attributed to light alone.\n\n## Interpret evidence proportionally\nA result may support a hypothesis under the tested conditions; it rarely proves a universal law by itself. Report the method, sample, variation and limitations. A null result can mean no detectable effect in this design—not necessarily that no effect exists anywhere.\n\n## Advanced transfer\nIn observational data, researchers may not control the variable at all. Then they must consider confounding, selection and measurement bias, and use cautious causal language. Reproducible methods and transparent uncertainty make evidence more useful.`,

      explanationMd: `# Units, Estimates & Significant Figures: Catch Errors Early\n\nUnits carry meaning. They can expose a wrong operation even when the arithmetic looks neat. Dimensional analysis checks whether the units on both sides of an equation are compatible; estimation checks whether the scale of the result is plausible.\n\n## Worked example\nA runner covers 400 m in 80 s. Average speed = distance/time = 400 m / 80 s = 5 m·s⁻¹. If a calculation gives 5 m·s, the unit is wrong: multiplying instead of dividing would also fail the dimensional check.\n\n## Convert before mixing units\nChoose a consistent unit system first. For example, 72 km/h = 72×1000/3600 m/s = 20 m/s. Write conversion factors as fractions so unwanted units cancel. Do not silently combine centimetres and metres or minutes and seconds.\n\n## Estimate before calculating precisely\nRound values to simple numbers, predict the order of magnitude, and compare the exact result. If a one-litre container appears to hold 80,000 litres in your answer, revisit prefixes and conversions.\n\n## Precision and uncertainty\nA result should not suggest more precision than the measurements support.
